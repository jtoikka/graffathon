# Graffathon

> A three-day computer graphics hackathon aimed at those without prior graphics coding or demoscene experience.

[Graffathon](http://www.graffathon.fi/2015/) is a three-day computer graphics hackathon aimed at novices. Each participating team created a short, non-interactive multimedia presentation (also known as a [demo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_(computer_programming)). The event was held from 12.6.2015 to 14.6.2015 at Otaniemi.
